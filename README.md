# The David Game

Shown to us by our uncle David, the David Game is my family's favorite pen-and-paper pastime at gatherings.
It's best played with a group of 4+ people, sitting around a table. Each player starts with a sheet of paper that has seven sections: four for writing and three for drawing. <br><br>
Each player starts by writing a sentence that can be drawn, ideally something creative and obscure.
Upon finishing their sentence, a player passes the sheet of paper to their right for the next player to illustrate their sentence.
After finishing their drawing, that second player folds back the original sentence and once again passes to the right for their neighbor to write a sentence summarizing the illustration.
This process continues, alternating from sentence to drawing, until all seven entries have been completed on every sheet of paper.<br><br>
Then the players go around the table, displaying their completed sheet to the group and showcasing the nuances and obsurities that evolved from their original sentence. Most people are terrible artists (myself included), which makes the game all the more amusing.<br><br>
My uncle told me that this was the perfect thing to get on the appstore, and I agreed, so I got to work.<br><br>
